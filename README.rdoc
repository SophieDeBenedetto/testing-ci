## to do:

- fix status message--why is "default" still showing up? why is "context" all wonky?
- add attrs to Result class/table for name, pr identifer, change controller code accordingly
- presenter object for error_messages object on result show page
- general styling for that page
- *After merge hook to delete result object. Maybe we should delete repo only after merge??
